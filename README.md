## Scripts

highlander
: - Before firing up an application make sure no other instance is running.
  - after cloning the repo make sure the script is executable
    - `chmod +x highlander.sh`
    - and, for convenience, the directory that holds it is added to your `$PATH`
    - you further might want to copy or symlink it to an already existing directory
      that holds your custom scripts. In that case make sure to provide the absolute
      path as a first arguemnt to the 
      `ln -s $PDW/path/to/repo/scripts/highlander.sh $PWD/.local/usr/bin/highlander`.
      The shell will not be able to find the files otherwise.
